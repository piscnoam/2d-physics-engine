A physics-based particle simulator built in Python using Pygame and NumPy. Particles interact using Newtonian gravity and can collide, merge, and leave fading trails. Features include real-time control over gravity, merging, and launching particles by click-dragging.

⸻

🚀 Features
    - Realistic gravitational attraction (with optional repulsion toggle)
    - Elastic or merging collisions
    - Click-and-drag launching system
    - Smooth trail rendering with fade
    - Adjustable gravity strength (using up and down arrow keys)
    - Pause/play, reset, and HUD display
    - Fully documented and modular code

⸻

🧪 Physics Modeled
    - Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²
    - Elastic Collisions (conservation of momentum)
    - Kinetic and Potential Energy Tracking

⸻

🎮 Controls
    - Mouse drag and release: Launch a particle
    - Spacebar: Pause or unpause the simulation
    - G key: Toggle gravity between attraction and repulsion
    - M key: Toggle merge-on-collision mode
    - Up arrow key: Increase gravity strength
    - Down arrow key: Decrease gravity strength
